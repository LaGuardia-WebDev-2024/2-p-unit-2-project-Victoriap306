    <h2 id="yummy-tummy" style="color: rgb(48, 24, 2);"><strong>CINNAMON ROLL COOKIES</strong></h2>
    <p class="cup">
     2 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
     1/2 tsp baking powder<br>
     1/4 tsp salt<br>
     3/4 cup unsalted butter<br>
     3/4 cup granulated sugar<br>
     1 large egg, room temp<br>
     2 Tbsp butter, melted and slightly cooled
    1/4 cup granulated sugar
    1 Tbsp ground cinnamon
    1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract<br>
     </p>
      
    <h4 id="OMG-OMG">Instuctions</h4>
    <p>
    1. Make the dough: Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt<br>
    together in a medium bowl. Set aside.<br>
    2. In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with<br>
    a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high<br>
     speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.<br> 
     Add the egg and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined,<br>
     about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the<br>
      bowl and beat again as needed to combine.<br>
    3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined.<br>
     Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling,<br>
     add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.<br>
    4. Shape and fill: Divide the dough into 2 equal parts.<br>
    Roll each portion out in a rectangle (about 9×7 inches) onto a floured silicone baking mat<br>
    (or floured parchment paper) to about 1/4″ thickness. Spread 1 Tablespoon of melted butter onto each rectangle. Mix the granulated sugar<br> 
    and cinnamon together then sprinkle evenly over each.<br>
    5. Working slowly, tightly roll up each rectangle into a 9-inch log.<br>
     If the dough is cracking at all, use your fingers to smooth it out. Some cracks are OK.<br>
      Chill the logs of dough for at least 2 hours (or freeze up to 3 months).<br>
      What I like to do is carefully transfer the logs<br>
       to a cutting board or plate and cover loosely with plastic wrap.<br>
    6. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.<br>
    7.Remove dough logs from the refrigerator. Cut into 1/2 inch slices.<br> 
    Place slices onto baking sheets about 2 inches apart.<br>
    8. Bake for 10-11 minutes, until lightly browned on the sides. Remove from the oven, allow to cool on the <br> 
    baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before icing.<br>
    9. Make the icing: Whisk all of the icing ingredients together. Drizzle over cookies.<br>
    10. Cover and store cookies at room temperature for up to 5 days<br>
